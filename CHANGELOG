Change update() to SECURITY DEFINER and remove grants on things that no longer
needed them.

Add schema references to several places.

Fix bug in max_end_time_to_delete. Previously, it would not consider the
requirements children had of their parents.

Second call to update_locks() in update() was completely broken.

Add crude update mechanism.
